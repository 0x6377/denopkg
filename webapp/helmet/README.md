# helmet is basic security headers for your web app

Idea (and name) is totally taken from https://github.com/helmetjs, which I have used in Koa and is a great little
middleware.

so far I have implemented:

- [x] frameguard
- [x] dns prefetch control
- [x] no sniff (mime types)
- [ ] csp
- [ ] expect CT (certificate transparency
- [ ] feature policy
- [ ] hsts
- [ ] referrer policy
- [ ]
